#python3 implementation to find the 
#minimum number of operations in 
#which the array A can be converted 
#to another array B 

#Given two arrays A[] and B[] of length N, the task is to find the 
#minimum number of operations in which the array A can be converted into 
#array B where each operation consists of adding an integer K into a subarray 
#from L to R.

# Utility function
def checkArray(arrA,arrB,n):
    operations = 0
    i = 0
    while(i < n):
        # if both elements are equal 
        # move to next element
        if ((arrA[i] - arrB[i])==0):
            i += 1
            continue
        # calculate the difference between
        # two elements
        diff = arrA[i] - arrB[i]
        i += 1
        # loop while next pair of elements have the same 
        # difference
        while ((i < n) & (arrA[i] - arrB[i] == diff)):
            i += 1
        #increase the number of 
        # operations required
